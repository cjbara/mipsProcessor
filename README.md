Simulates a MIPS processor in C++
The folders are for different increments in the project. Decode has the ability to decode hex streams into MIPS assembly. The mem-reg folder updates the functionality of memory and registers. The execute folder has an executable that allows us to run a MIPS program. This last folder uses QTSpim log files to run.
